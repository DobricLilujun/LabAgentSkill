## Skill Overview

This skill helps classify sentences from financial documents into specific XBRL tags based on the numeric entity mentioned and the context in which it appears. The classification relies on understanding key phrases, financial terminology, and the relationships between different types of financial data.


### Tag Definitions

#### 1. Interest Rate Tags

**DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage**
- Fixed/stated rates on notes/bonds: "5.25% Senior Notes"
- "interest at X% per annum"
- NOT for LIBOR rate values

**DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1**
- Margin/spread on variable rate: "LIBOR plus 1.75%", "margin of 2.00%"
- "LIBOR was X%" → use this tag

#### 2. Debt Amount Tags

**DebtInstrumentFaceAmount**
- Principal/face amount at issuance
- Terms: "principal amount", "aggregate principal amount", "face amount"
- Examples: "$575.0 million aggregate principal amount"
- Derivative notional: "total notional of interest rate swaps was $300.0 million"

**DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount**
- Current book value on balance sheet
- Terms: "balance", "outstanding", "carrying amount", "as of [date]"
- Examples: "balance was $273.4 million"

**LongTermDebt**
- Total long-term debt balance

- Examples:
  - "$1.99 billion revolving credit facility"
  - "$2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility"

- Examples: "redeemable at 102.313%", "issue price of 99.78% of face value"

## Critical Disambiguation Rules

### Rule 1: Interest Rates
- LIBOR rate values → DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1
- Fixed/stated rates on notes/bonds → DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage
- Margin/spread on variable rate → DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1

### Rule 2: Debt Amounts
- Issuance/principal amount → DebtInstrumentFaceAmount
- Current balance/book value → DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount
- Fair/market value → LongTermDebtFairValue
- "balance of [Named Term Loan]" → LongTermDebt
- Generic/unclear → LongTermDebt
- Issue price percentage → DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage
- Derivative notional → DebtInstrumentFaceAmount

### Rule 3: Credit Facilities
- "of up to $X" or standalone facility amount → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
- "$X available" → LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity
- "$X facility with $Y outstanding" → LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity
- "$X outstanding borrowings" (no facility context) → LineOfCredit
- Bank guarantees outstanding → LineOfCredit
- Letters of credit outstanding → LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount

### Rule 4: Context is King
- Read the full sentence to understand what the number represents
- "$X revolving credit facility" (standalone) = Maximum capacity
- "$X outstanding borrowings" = Current usage

## Common Patterns

### Facility Descriptions
"$X revolving credit facility" (standalone) → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
"$X unsecured revolving credit facility" → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
"$X secured revolving credit facility" → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
"$X credit facility that matures in [date]" → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
"$X revolving line of credit" → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
"$X facility of up to" → LineOfCreditFacilityMaximumBorrowingCapacity
"$X available" → LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity
"$X facility with $Y outstanding" → LineOfCreditFacilityCurrentBorrowingCapacity
"$X outstanding borrowings" → LineOfCredit
"$X of indebtedness" → LineOfCredit
"$X outstanding in revolver borrowings" → LineOfCredit
"$X letter of credit with no outstanding balance" → LineOfCredit

### Interest Rate Descriptions
"X% Senior Notes" → DebtInstrumentInterestRateStatedPercentage
"LIBOR plus X%" → DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1
"LIBOR was X%" → DebtInstrumentBasisSpreadOnVariableRate1

### Debt Issuance
"issued $X principal amount" → DebtInstrumentFaceAmount
"total notional of interest rate swaps" → DebtInstrumentFaceAmount
"balance of the [Named Term Loan]" → LongTermDebt
"carrying amount of the mortgage notes" → LongTermDebt
"balance was $X" → DebtInstrumentCarryingAmount
"fair value of $X" → LongTermDebtFairValue
"issue price of X%" → DebtInstrumentRedemptionPricePercentage

### Credit Instruments
"bank guarantees outstanding" → LineOfCredit
"letters of credit outstanding" → LettersOfCreditOutstandingAmount
